# Overview
> This project is currently in alpha and under active development.

### Long term project goals
Full port of the original C# [NEO project](https://github.com/neo-project). A complete toolkit for the NEO blockchain.

- Full server (consensus and RPC) nodes.
- RPC client
- build, compile and deploy smart contracts with the Go vm

### Current state
This project is still under heavy development. Still working on internal API's and project layout. This should not take longer than 2 weeks. 

The project will exist out of the following topics/packages:

1. network (started) 
2. core (started)
3. api (JSON-RPC server) (started)
4. vm (open)
5. smartcontract (open)

# Getting started 
### Server

Install the neoserver cli `go install ./cmd/neoserver`

Currently, there is a minimal subset of the NEO protocol implemented. To start experimenting make sure you a have a private net running on your machine. If you dont, take a look at [docker-privnet-with-gas](https://hub.docker.com/r/metachris/neo-privnet-with-gas/). 

Start the server:

`neoserver -seed 127.0.0.1:20333`

You can add multiple seeds if you want:

`neoserver -seed 127.0.0.1:20333,127.0.01:20334`

By default the server will currently run on port 3000, for testing purposes. You can change that by setting the tcp flag:

`neoserver -seed 127.0.0.1:20333 -tcp 1337`

### RPC
If you want your node to also serve JSON-RPC, you can do that by setting the following flag:

`neoserver -rpc 4000`

In this case server will accept and respond JSON-RPC on port 4000. Keep in mind that currently there is only a small subset of the JSON-RPC implemented. Feel free to make a PR with more functionality.

### vm
To be implemented..

### smart contracts
To be implemented..
